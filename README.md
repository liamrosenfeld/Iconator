#  Iconology
I got tired of manually exporting every icon size, so I made a app to do it.

## Features
- Converts iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, iMessage, and Mac right out of the box
- Can easily create presets to customise it to your development setup
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Exports images with the same file name as displayed in the IDE, so adding them in the correct spot is a breeze
- Works with .png, .jpg, .ai, .psd, and .pdf
