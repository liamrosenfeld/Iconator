#  Iconizer
I got tired of manually exporting every icon size, so I made a app to do it.

## Features
- Supports iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Exports images with the same file name as in Xcode, so adding them to the correct spot is a breeze
- Works with .png, .jpg, .ai, .psd, and .pdf
